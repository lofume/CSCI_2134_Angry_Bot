Refactorings:
=============

0. EXAMPLE:  
   File: SpressoBot.java, ChickenBot.java, AngryBot.java, TimBot.java
   Location (method/approx. line #): getNextMove()
   Issue Identified: Common code to check if move will result in 
                    energy use and decrement energyLevel if that 
                    is the case
   Description of fix:  Push the common code into TimBot.java, creating a
                        protected method to be used instead.
   Implemented: Yes (Completely, all tests pass)

1. File: bullyBot.java, timBot.java 
   Location (method/approx. line #): fireCannon()
   Issue Identified: Common method fireCannon() in both classes
   Description of fix: create a protected method in timBot.java to house the code from bullyBot 
   Implemented: No

2. File: timBot.java, district.java
   Location (method/approx. line #): senseDistrict()
   Issue Identified: Method senseDistrict() common to both class timBot.java and district.java class, single 			     responsibility principle
   Description of fix: make senseDistrict() in district.java a void reference to timBot.java senseDistrict()
   Implemented: Yes (all tests pass)

3. File: timBot.java
   Location (method/approx. line #): useMoveEnergy(), useJolt()
   Issue Identified: Duplicate decrement energyLevel code in both useMoveEnergy() and useJolt()
   Description of fix: replace duplicate code in useMoveEnergy() and replace it with reference to useJolt()
   Implemented: Yes (all tests pass)
